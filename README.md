# sentiment-Analsis-using-Deep-learning
This project focuses on sentiment analysis for Arabic text using deep learning techniques, including transformers, recurrent neural networks (RNN), and convolutional neural networks (CNN). The goal is to build a robust model that accurately classifies Arabic text into different sentiment classes, such as positive, negative, or neutral.
